  "content": "A video showing violence at a high school in Tochigi Prefecture was shared widely on social media. The video was filmed by students involved in the incident. Later, people who were not involved shared it online. Experts warn that this can lead to risks such as privacy invasion and negative effects on children's development. Attorney Yohei Shimizu noted that filming such incidents can make both the attackers and the bystanders responsible. For the victim, being filmed without consent raises issues of their rights.",
